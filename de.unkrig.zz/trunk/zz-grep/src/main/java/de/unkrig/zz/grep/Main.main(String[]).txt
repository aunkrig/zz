Usage:
======

  zzgrep [ <option> ... ] [ - ] <regex> <file-or-dir> ...
      Reads <file> or all files under <dir> and prints all lines which contain
      matches of the <regex>.
  zzgrep [ <option> ... ] <regex>
      Reads STDIN and prints all lines which contain matches of the <regex>.

Options:
========

  --help
      Print this text and terminate.

File Selection:
---------------

  --dont-sort-directory-members
      By default directory members are sorted lexicographically in order to
      achieve deterministic results.
  --look-into <glob>
      Look into compressed and archive contents if "<format>:<path>" matches
      the glob. The default is to look into any recognised archive or
      compressed contents.
      Supported archive formats in this runtime configuration are:
      ${archive.formats}
      Supported compression formats in this runtime configuration are:
      ${compression.formats}
  --exclude <regex>
  --include <regex>
      Excludes files and archive entries from the search iff the file's /
      archive entry's path matches the <regex>.
      Any number of --exclude and --include options can be given, and later
      take precedence over the earlier.
      The default is that <all> files and archive entries are included; thus
      you would always begin with a --exclude option.
  --zip
  --zz
  --nested-zip
  --gzip
      <*Deprecated* - Use --look-into instead.>

--------------------

  --encoding <charset>
      Contents encoding, default is "${file.encoding}".
  -i
  --ignore-case
      Ignore case distinctions.
  -v
  --inverted
      Select non-matching lines.
  --da
  --disassemble-class-files
      Disassemble .class files on-the-fly.
  --da-no-lines
  --disassemble-class-files-but-hide-lines
      Don't print line numbers in the disassembly.
  --da-no-vars
  --disassemble-class-files-but-hide-vars
      Don't print variable names in the disassembly.

Output Generation:
------------------

  -l
  --list
      Print only names of files containing matches.
  -q

      Print verbose and debug messages.
  --log <level>:<logger>:<handler>:<formatter>:<format>
      Add logging at level FINE on logger "de.unkrig" to STDERR using the

      optional).

Example <glob>s:
----------------

  dir/file
      File "file" in directory "dir"
  file.gz%
      Compressed file "file.gz"
  file.zip!dir/file
      Entry "dir/file" in archive file "dir/file.zip"
  file.tar.gz%!dir/file
      Entry "dir/file" in the compressed archive file "file.tar.gz"
  */x
      File "x" in an immediate subdirectory
  **/x
      File "x" in any subdirectory
  ***/x
      File "x" in any subdirectory, or any entry "**/x" in any archive file in
      any subdirectory
  a,dir/file.7z!dir/b
      File "a" and entry "dir/b" in archive file "dir/file.7z"
  ~*.c
      Files that don't end with ".c"
  ~*.c~*.h
      Files that don't end with ".c" or ".h"
  ~*.c~*.h,foo.c
